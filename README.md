Step 1:Data Cleaning

Remove irrevelant data, Handling the missing values,fix error,Language Translation

Step 2:EDA

Analyse and investigate the data

Step 4:Try different classification models

Logistic regression,Decision tree,random forest and Gradient boosting are implemented here

Step 5:Choose the model which gives the higher accuracy

Use Evaluation netrics to evaluvate the model such as accuracy,recall,precision and ROC curve
